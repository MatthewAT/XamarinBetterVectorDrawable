# [Obsolete]
Android support library supports vector drawable since version 23.2.0 ([how to use](https://medium.com/@chrisbanes/appcompat-v23-2-age-of-the-vectors-91cbafa87c88#.s8ak3guum)), please use it instead of BetterVectorDrawable. BetterVectorDrawable still works, but isn't maintained any more.
